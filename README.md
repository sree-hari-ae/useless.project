### Project Description
[This is a simple interactive web project that performs a classic math guessing game. It guides users through a sequence of mathematical steps to secretly think of a number between 1 and 50.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[This project demonstrates a classic math trick that ‚Äúguesses‚Äù the number you think of (between 1 and 50) by using a series of simple arithmetic steps.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[This project solves the ultimate mystery ‚Äî guessing the number you secretly thought of between 1 and 50. How? Through pure mathematical magic disguised as simple arithmetic steps.]
